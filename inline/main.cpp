/**
   inline functions generally short and frequently referred books

   actually inline keyword is a wish tell to compiler "if possibly when this function calls do not use linker
                                                        please code of compiled form copy where call in lines :) "
    inline functions can be use maybe not that situation is on about compiler

    ATTENTION ===> inline function definitions stay in header file!!!! That is not UB do not worry be happy :)

    One Definition Rule (ODR) ===> about "inline" functions

    !!!!!Anyone can see all function definition and that situation is disadvantage here!!!!!

    ATTENTION ===> The compiler use inline optimizing in RUNTIME
